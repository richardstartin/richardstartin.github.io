I wrote a <a href="https://richardstartin.github.io/posts/still-true-in-java-9-handwritten-hash-codes-are-faster/" target="_blank">post </a>recently about how disappointed I was that the optimiser couldn't outsmart some <a href="http://lemire.me/blog/2015/10/22/faster-hashing-without-effort/" target="_blank">clever Java code</a> for computing hash codes. Well, here's a faster hash code along the same lines.

The hash code implemented in `Arrays.hashCode` is a polynomial hash, it applies to any data type with a positional interpretation. It takes the general form $latex \sum_{i=0}^{n}x_{i}31^{n - i}$ where $latex x_0 = 1$. In other words, it's a dot product of the elements of the array and some powers of 31. Daniel Lemire's implementation makes it explicit to the optimiser, in a way it won't otherwise infer, that this operation is data parallel. If it's really just a dot product it can be made even more obvious at the cost of a loss of flexibility.

Imagine you are processing fixed or limited length strings (VARCHAR(255) or an URL) or coordinates of a space of fixed dimension. Then you could pre-compute the coefficients in an array and write the hash code explicitly as a dot product. Java 9 uses AVX instructions for dot products, so it should be very fast.

```java
public class FixedLengthHashCode {

    private final int[] coefficients;

    public FixedLengthHashCode(int maxLength) {
        this.coefficients = new int[maxLength + 1];
        coefficients[maxLength] = 1;
        for (int i = maxLength - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            coefficients[i] = 31 * coefficients[i + 1];
        }
    }

    public int hashCode(int[] value) {
        int result = coefficients[0];
        for (int i = 0; i < value.length && i < coefficients.length - 1; ++i) {
            result += coefficients[i + 1] * value[i];
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

This is really explicit, unambiguously parallelisable, and the results are remarkable.

Modifying the algorithm slightly to support limited variable length arrays degrades performance slightly, but there are seemingly equivalent implementations which do much worse.

```java
public class FixedLengthHashCode {

    private final int[] coefficients;

    public FixedLengthHashCode(int maxLength) {
        this.coefficients = new int[maxLength + 1];
        coefficients[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= maxLength; ++i) {
            coefficients[i] = 31 * coefficients[i - 1];
        }
    }

    public int hashCode(int[] value) {
        final int max = value.length;
        int result = coefficients[max];
        for (int i = 0; i < value.length && i < coefficients.length - 1; ++i) {
            result += coefficients[max - i - 1] * value[i];
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
